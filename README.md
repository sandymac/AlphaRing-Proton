> **This repository is AlphaRing for use on SteamOS with Proton GE 11-6, to enable Halo: The Master
> Chief Collection split screen on a Valve Steam Machine.** It is a fork of
> [megabitt01/AlphaRing](https://github.com/megabitt01/AlphaRing) with one build fix that stops the
> upstream DLL from crashing at startup under Proton ("Fatal error!"), plus file logging.
> Prebuilt `WTSAPI32.dll` is on the [Releases](https://github.com/sandymac/AlphaRing-Proton/releases)
> page. Read **[STEAMOS-PROTON.md](STEAMOS-PROTON.md)** for install steps, the root cause, and debugging.

## What's New in This Fork

### Features Added

#### 1. Controller-to-Player Binding (Splitscreen)
- Each player now has a **"Bind" button** next to the controller dropdown
- Click "Bind" → Press any button on a controller → Automatically assigns that controller to the player
- No more guessing which controller is "Controller 1" vs "Controller 2"

#### 2. Button-to-Action Binding (Gamepad Mapping)
- Each action in the Gamepad Mapping section has a **"Bind" button**
- Click "Bind" → Press a button → That button is assigned to the action

#### 3. Fixed Default Gamepad Mappings
- **Bug fixed:** Previously, all actions defaulted to "Left Trigger" due to uninitialized memory
- **Now:** New profiles initialize with standard Xbox Halo controls:

| Action | Button |
|--------|--------|
| Jump | A |
| Melee | B |
| Action/Interact | X |
| Change Weapon | Y |
| Reload | RB |
| Switch Grenades | LB |
| Shoot | RT |
| Throw Grenade | LT |
| Flashlight | D-pad Up |
| Crouch | Left Stick Click |
| Zoom | Right Stick Click |

### Features
* Splitscreen (all games)
* Camera Tool (H3)
* Object Browser (H3)

### Installation
Make sure you have the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.

Download the latest stable build from the [Releases](https://github.com/kirklandsig/AlphaRing/releases) page.

Place the DLL into the "Halo The Master Chief Collection\mcc\binaries\win64" directory and launch the game with EAC off.

For Running on Steam Deck/Linux, add the following command in the Steam Game Launch Options:
```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="WTSAPI32=n,b" %command%
```

#### Batocera Linux / Steam Deck

Works with **any Proton version** (Proton 9.0, Proton Experimental, Proton GE, etc.)

1. **Configure the game**:
   - Right-click MCC → Properties → Compatibility
   - Enable "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool"
   - Select any Proton version (Proton 9.0, Experimental, or Proton GE all work)

2. **Set launch options**: Add the following to Steam Launch Options:
   ```
   WINEDLLOVERRIDES="WTSAPI32=n,b" %command%
   ```

3. **Controller Setup (Important for non-Xbox controllers)**:
   - For 8BitDo and other third-party controllers, enable **Steam Input** for the controller
   - Go to Steam → Settings → Controller → Enable "Xbox Configuration Support"
   - This allows Steam to translate your controller inputs to XInput, which MCC and AlphaRing expect
   - Without this, some buttons (like A or stick clicks) may not be detected

> **Note:** Tested on Batocera Linux with the unofficial Batocera add-ons Steam client.

### Usage
Toggle menu: `F4` or `Controller Back` + `Controller Start`

To navigate using Controller use the `Right Stick` to move the mouse and `RB` to click.

When the menu is open, game input is disabled.
